# Analysis of Police Fatal Encounters in Kansas and Missouri

## Description

_Following waves of protests demanding justice for police killings, more people in Kansas City are paying more attention to the specific policies that guide use of force for officers. One set of solutions called "8 Can't Wait" measures eight different policies that police departments could implement to reduce police killings. The KCPD currently has none of the eight policies in place, and the department is not without its own history with officers killing Black residents. This piece would explore the 8 Can't Wait solutions, their efficacy in being implemented, and how the KCPD's failure to implement any of the eight policies has affected violent interactions between officers and the police._
