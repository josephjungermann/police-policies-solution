The deputy chased after Gwyn on foot and yelled at him to stop. Gwyn allegedly pointed a handgun behind him while running and fired a shot, then stopped and put the gun to his head and began walking away with the deputy following him. The deputy said Gwyn began to turn towards him, so he began shooting at Gwyn, who died at the scene. Other officers arrived and noted that Gwyn had a gunshot wound to the head. The autopsy report said that Gwyn had also been shot in the upper back. http://www.sedgwickcounty.org/da/criminal_media/2013/Media%20Release%20-%20Horace%20Gwyn%20III%20(2).pdf",nan,12582.0,2013
