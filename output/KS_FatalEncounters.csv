Backup officers arrived from several agencies and tried to convince the man to surrender, but weren't successful, police said. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., the man reportedly exited the pickup, walked toward the field and shot himself in the chest with a .45 handgun. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B62PuBu1vKRLb2ZVSnRFZGI4M0k/view?usp=sharing",,12144.0,2012
