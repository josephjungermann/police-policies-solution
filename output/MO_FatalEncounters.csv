Keith, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, shot and killed officer Terry Foster during an hour-long standoff, then was killed in an explosion. Keith's elderly parents had called police saying he was violent and needed to go to a hospital for evaluation. Foster knew Keith from earlier calls and talked to him through a locked door, police said. When officers forced the door open, Foster was shot four times. As other officers pulled Foster downstairs, the house erupted into flames after about 15 oxygen tanks Keith's ailing father kept in a closet exploded. Officials weren't sure what had triggered the explosion. Uncertain as to whether all the tanks had exploded, firefighters did not enter the house. Hours later, police found Keith's body in the garage. http://www.examiner.net/article/20110318/NEWS/303189776",,816.0,2001

Christensen and Kevin G. Haywood, Sergeant Dale E. Knox, and trooper Eric R. Kolb; PCSD deputy Joshua Quimby shot Seth L. Martin after he reportedly drove over two sets of spike strips and began firing at officers during a high-speed chase. According to the patrol, Christensen tried to stop Martin's Dodge pickup in in Buchanan County for speeding just after 10:30 p.m. on I-29, but he didn't pull over. A 20-minute chase ensued and Christensen was joined by Kolb and Quimby. Martin eventually stopped his truck and allegedly grabbed an Armalite M15A2 rifle, got out and shot at the officers, who returned fire. Officials said that Martin ran up an embankment on the west side of the freeway, where he sat facing the officers and appeared to be doing something with his weapon. After about a 30-second pause, Martin allegedly lifted and aimed his rifle at the officers and began to fire. Officers returned fire, striking Martin eight times including two shots to his head.

""Trooper Sullivan stated the final test was a preliminary breath test, which was done,"" stated the report. ""The reading on the instrument was .12 percent and rising."" The trooper told the subject he was under arrest for driving while intoxicated as the subject told him that ""he wasn't drunk"" and became combative. An altercation ensued between the two. ""Trooper Sullivan stated ... he was scared the subject was going to kill him and if he was struck one more time he might get knocked out and killed."" Mr. Sullivan fired three shots that caused the motorist, who was outside the vehicle at that point, to fall to the ground. Mr. Sullivan retrieved his first-aid kit to render aid to the man and repositioned his patrol vehicle to protect the subject and himself until additional help arrived, the report said. http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/article_e31341a3-258d-527a-a7c9-972409328340.html",,12309.0,2013

At about 7:45 a.m., school officials said a staff member saw Wittrock with a long gun in the parking lot. The school was immediately placed on protective lockdown and police were notified. Wittrock left in a Ford Explorer and police stopped the teen about 2 miles from the high school. A witness said several officers surrounded Wittrock's SUV with their guns drawn. ""I heard cops yelling, 'Get on the ground! Get on the ground,'"" the witness said. ""Their guns were drawn out, shotguns everywhere, and I heard a couple of bang noises. There might have been shots fired."" According to police, the officers heard a gunshot inside the SUV as they approached, and then found Wittrock dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. http://fox4kc.com/2014/04/11/warrensburg-high-school-taking-precautions-over-reports-of-gunfire/",,14335.0,2014
